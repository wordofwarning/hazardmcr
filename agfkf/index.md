Part performance, part demonstration, *Nothing Like This To Increase The Adrenaline Rush of the Crowd* challenges the role of the consumer in modern day society. The audience will be treated as a general public in the same way shoppers gather around a promotional trolley in a shopping mall. Gale-Feeny and Fishman ask the public to question what they are being sold and why they are being seduced.     

This performance has been brought on a bus by Hatch, Nottinghamâ€™s mobile platform for live art. Part of Hatching Space and supported by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.
