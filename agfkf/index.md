This novelty demo event takes the notion and object of a siren, within the context of safety product promotion, game shows, and shopping channels. Capitalising on unlikely events and eccentric uses is a key element within the marketing of these products. For one day only, this pop-up duo will speculate around imagined eventualities, scenarios and product specifications, examining how a performance presentation is framed from within and beyond the perspective of the camera operator.    

Alice Gale-Feeny and Katherine Fishman obtained their Fine Art degrees at Nottingham Trent University. Most recently they curated an exhibition examining how language, speech-delivery and gesture alter between the media of performance and video.
