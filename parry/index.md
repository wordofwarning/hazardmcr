A durational live art still life, using re-located sand from Skegness and recycled super-8 footage from her family’s archives; as a ‘man-made’ beach, the body becomes a site to explore memories and nostalgia and ethics of transformation, ritual and regeneration. 
   
This performance has been brought on a bus by Hatch, Nottingham’s mobile platform for live art. Part of Hatching Space and supported by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.
