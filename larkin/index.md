Larkin' About is excited to be bringing a flurry of playful events to this year's Hazard.     
Reinventing Manchester's playtime, Larkin' About hosts a series of gaming events through the year.  If you see a covert phone call taking place, a giddy team of players sneaking past, or an unsuspecting member of the public on a tour of the secret side of the city -   you've found us!       
Players will be chasing and racing, searching and collecting, and code-breaking and puzzle-solving in a series of games through St Ann's Square.  Bring stealth, energy, and a sense of play.     
Come and find us at the desk next to the bus - we'll have your missions ready...     
Full programme details will be published here leading up to the event.
