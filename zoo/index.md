Zoo Indigo stage a family picnic during the day in hazardous locations. The duo will frantically create the chaos and joy of daily family hysteria as they work around their flat pack children. Watchers will be given parental responsibilities to ensure the family are having a 'good time'.    

Using a large old pram, *Flat Out* will take a journey from the bus, around St Ann’s Square, hunting for inappropriate settings for family picnics.
