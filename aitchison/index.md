Created in London and Beijing, *2012* is a soapbox performance evoking a world where conspiracy theories, propaganda, science, art and politics cross over with one another to become indistinguishable.    

Bill Aitchison is a performance artist who has presented his performances, soundworks and videos in galleries, theatres and festivals in Europe, Asia, America and The Middle East. He is well known as a writer and performer through collaborative projects in Europe and the US, has published critical articles and reviews in several countries and has made a number of pieces for radio.   

*2012* was created with James Dunn (sound) and Boris Kahnery (light) and developed with the support of Arts Council England, Institute for Provocation Beijing, Burton Taylor Studio Oxford and Chisenhale Dance Space London.
