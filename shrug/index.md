SHRUG ‘happenings’ began with an urge for glamour, a chance to turn monotonous actions into durational acts: performances for everyone to view. The audience is the general public, anyone and everyone who wants to interact is encouraged to do so, or walk by, or stare from afar.    

For Hazard, SHRUG respond to the themes and context of the festival and their interactions will reference the themes of travel and holiday.
