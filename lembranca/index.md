Wearing the iconic orange coveralls synonymous with Guantanamo Bay, a group of performers appear in the public realm, their very presence raising questions about global practices of incarceration, human rights, war crimes, citizenship, and national identity.     

Concept and Design by Rea Dennis and Magda Miranda, Lembrança UK.
From the Nooks and Crannies Festival (Brisbane 2000) to recent work in Brazil (Pedaços 2012) Rea Dennis's work integrates real stories with improvised performance. Trained in traditional and physical theatre performance, she began to specialise in live improvised performance in 1994 and her work is framed by performed autobiography and memory. She performed regularly in Australia until relocating to UK in 2005.
