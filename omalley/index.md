200 soldiers have completed their tours of duty, but now find themselves in yet more unfamiliar territory.    
       
Left alone to fend for themselves, the soldiers' new mission is to conquer and survive the urban landscape of Manchester.     

Coloured gold and unable to shift or move from their military pose, they look on, unnoticed, as unsung heroes of the city.    

Julieann O'Malley is an interdisciplinary artist based in Liverpool, UK.    
*"I make live performance, installation & video work that's raw, visceral, emotionally charged and evocative. I like to test the limits of my body as well as using it as a material in my work. I have a great fascination for the possibilities of the future of the human race  and am passionate about people's personal connections with one another and the world around them."*
