Dressed up in tropical gear, and with an acoustic guitar, Simon Raven will become an itinerant busker, playing *Summer Holiday* and other songs, around a vintage double-decker bus and giving the audience a penny to listen to him, subverting the usual transaction that takes place when busking.    

A comment on the idea of the stay-cation and the ironic act of going on a holiday from one city centre to another in a recession.
