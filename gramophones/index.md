In April 2012, three women made a journey from one end of Great Britain to the other. Trusting only to their resourcefulness and the kindness of strangers they made an 18-day, 874-mile journey from Land’s End to John O’Groats. 

This is a story about why we leave places, why we stay and what we imagine of places we have never been to. The Gramophones create a map of the UK from objects found on the journey.
