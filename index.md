bigtext: "Welcome to Hazard 2012, Manchester's biennial microfestival of incidental intervention and spreeful scootery.  Now with added Hatch and Larkin'!"

---

Sneaking up on you from behind a bus, Manchester's stripiest festival returns to unleash its fourth wave of bizarre behaviour on the city centre. 

In this year of all things Games, get fit in the hula-hoopathon, see the goal posts shifting, or take a soapbox tour from the Olympics to the End of the World. 

See the world through teen eyes, locate a missing soldier, make your protest or join our flatpack Nottingham tourists on their summer holiday to the North West.

For just one day, Manchester's St Ann's Square becomes the hub for random actions, strange antics and ludic activities.    

If you want to find us, look for the big red busâ€¦ or keep your eyes peeled for a flash of yellow and black - anywhere in the Square or beyond.

**Hatch** is a theatre without a building based in Nottingham and a platform for live art in the East Midlands. Showing unusual work in interesting places, Hatch exists to help performers and audiences to meet and take risks together. **Hatch at Hazard**, and its big red bus, is part of **Hatching Space**, a six month programme of performance-y work around the UK supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England.

Reinventing Manchester's playtime, **Larkin' About** hosts a series of gaming events through the year.  Events see players chasing and racing, searching and collecting, and code-breaking and puzzle-solving in a series of games and playful experiences.
