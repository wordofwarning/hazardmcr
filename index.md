Welcome to **Hazard 2012**, Manchester's biennial microfestival of incidental intervention and spreeful scootery. Now with added Hatch and Larks.

Sneaking up on you from behind a bus, Manchester's stripiest festival returns to unleash its fourth wave of bizarre behaviour on the city centre. 

In this year of all things Games, get fit in the hula-hoopathon, see the goal posts shifting, or take a soapbox tour from the Olympics to the End of the World. 

See the world through teen eyes, locate a missing soldier, find your romantic hero on a street-corner or join our flatpack Nottingham tourists on their Summer Holiday to the North West.

For just one day, Manchester's St Ann's Square becomes the hub for random actions, strange antics and ludic activities.  
If you want to find us, look for the big red busâ€¦ or keep your eyes peeled for a flash of yellow and black - anywhere in the Square or beyond.
