Thank you for joining me on this bench today.     

A bench with a plaque reading ‘Sit with me for a moment and remember’ is placed in St Ann’s Square.    

You are invited to sit on the bench for five minutes to listen to a recording that reflects on what it means to sit for a moment and remember.
